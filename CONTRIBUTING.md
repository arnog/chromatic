# Contributing to the Project

There are many ways you can get involved with the project. Contributing to an open source project is fun and rewarding.

## Funding

Consider donating to project development via [Patreon](https://patreon.com/arnog) (recurring donation) or [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/arnogourdol) (one time donation).

Encourage the business partners in your organization to provide financial support of open source projects.

Funds go to general development, support, and infrastructure costs.

We welcome both individual and corporate sponsors. In addition to Patreon and PayPal, we can also accept short-term development contracts for specific features or maintenance of the project.

## Contributing Issues

If you're running into some problems or something doesn't
behave the way you think it should, please file an issue in GitHub.

Before filing something, have a look at the existing issues. It's better to avoid filing duplicates. You can
add a comment to an existing issue if you'd like.

### Can I help fix a bug?

Sure! Have a look at the issue report, and make sure no one is already
working on it. If the issue is assigned to someone, they're on it!
Otherwise, add a comment in the issue indicating you'd like to work on
resolving the issue and go for it!

Whether you have a fix for an issue, some improved test cases, or a brand
new feature, we welcome contributions in the form of pull requests.
