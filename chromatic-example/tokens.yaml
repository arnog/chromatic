# This token file is using the .yaml format, but tokens files can also
# be authored using JSON5 (JSON with comments)

# A token file should have a mandatory "tokens" key
tokens:
    # Token names can contain letters, digits, '_' or '-'.
    # The value of a token can be a literal (constant) or an expression.
    # Some literals have units, here 'px' for pixels.
    border-radius: '4px'

    # Here we define a length using an arithmetic expression.
    # The syntax of token expressions follows closely the CSS level-4 syntax.

    # Defining an angle using the 'deg' unit
    primary-hue: '200deg'

    # A token expression can reference another token by enclosing it in "{}"
    # Functions can be used to perform more complex calculations
    # The 'hsl()' function will return a color based on a hue, saturation and lightness
    # Other color functions include "rgb()", "hsv()", "hwb()" and "lab()"
